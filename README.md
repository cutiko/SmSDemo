##Simple example of how to use SMS##

Focus on the `directSend()` and `indirectSend()` methods in the MainActivity.class

#Pending#

1. I notice a lot of problems with bad operator signal, in the first commit you can see I was working on that, but need more testing
2. SMS between some companies doesn't even happened, I talk with a friend who have a project using intensively SMS and he told me that is indeed a problem but communications are not making them self responsibles about it, there should be some sort of listener to know if the message was send or not... maybe if it was delivered?

Any contribution is appreciate it.
